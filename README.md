# Parkinsons_disease_Prediction_using_machine_learning_models
This project's goal is to know which prediction algorithm is performing better among various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network algorithms in order to detect and classify the person suffering from Parkinson's disease or not using python.
